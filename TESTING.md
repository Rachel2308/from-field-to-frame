# **Testing**

## **Bugs**

* **Issue**

    Buttons were not aligning on some of the allauth templates


    **Fix**
    
    Found to be an issue with getting the home button aligning with the input on some of the pages. Additional CSS class written to change the home button CSS when it was paired with an input instead of a button


  ---

* **Issue**
    
    Toasts were not displaying on anything other than the basket page


    **Fix**
    
    {{ block.super }} was missed off the templates. The BTT JS was overriding the base template JS so the toasts could not be displayed


  ---

*   **Issue**
    
    Having worked properly previously, the sign up form boxes were now very small. 


    **Fix**
    
    From inspecting the front end, it turned out that the sign up form and quantity picker shared a class name. Once the quanitity picker size had been amended for smaller screens, this affected the sign up form. I changed the class name on the quantity picker so they could now be styled independently

  ---

*   **Issue**
    
    The cards on the art, furniture and blog pages overapped. This caused the buttons on those cards to not function. Chnging the CSS on these cards did not affect the margin.


    **Fix**
    
    Once the card size was amended from h-100 to h-90 the issue was resolved.

*   **Issue**
    
    Sort function in Blogs home page caused account dropdown to show


    **Fix**
    
    Found missing container-fluid div, problem solved once opening div added

  *   **Issue**
    Adding a piece of art with no image results in an error page. 

    **Fix**
    
    The placement of the "View larger image" link was causing the error. Moved inside the if statement, issue resolved.

---

  *   **Issue**
    Increment and decrement buttons were making the quantity select button reder poorly on smaller screens

    **Fix**
    
    Added code to CSS to remove the - + buttons on medium and smaller screen sizes. It was also felt that they were not necessary on smaller screen sizes 

---

  *   **Issue**
    On firefox, the 3 footer links were not aligned. This was only an issue on firefox and no other browser.

    **Fix**
    
    A stray mt-3 tag had been left in the instagram link in the footer. This was only changing the margin on the firefoc and no other browser. Once this was removed they lined up on all browsers.

---

  *   **Issue**
    Error pages would not load

    **Fix**
    
    I had made a mistake in the templates for the error pages and used the link <a class="error-link" href="{{ url ('home') }}">Go back to the home page</a> instead of <a class="error-link" href="{% url 'home' %}">Go back to the home page</a>
